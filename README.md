## What are PWAs?
PWAs i.e. Progressive Web Apps are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications. 


## Why should I care?
Two reasons: 

(1) Internet connections are flaky. They break-off when you least expect it and as a result are unreliable

(2) PWAs leverage the open standards of the web offered by modern browsers to provide benefits of a rich mobile experience
